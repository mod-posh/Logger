## [[1.0.1]](https://github.com/mod-posh/Logger/releases/tag/v1.0.1) - 2024-08-05

This is just a small update, some documentation fixes and a version change as nuget.org only supports semver version numbers so was truncating anything past the patch version.

## [[1.0.0.0]](https://github.com/mod-posh/Logger/releases/tag/v1.0.0.0) - 2024-01-05

This should be a usable logger in both C# and PowerShell, which I've struggled with lately. It should be simple and allow logging to a file or the console if needed.
