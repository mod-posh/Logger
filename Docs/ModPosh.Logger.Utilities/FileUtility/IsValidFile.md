# FileUtility.IsValidFile method

Checks if the provided path is a valid file path and not a directory, and if the directory part of the path exists.

```csharp
public static bool IsValidFile(string path)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| path | The file path to validate. |

## Return Value

`true` if the path is a valid file path and its directory part exists; otherwise, `false`.

## Remarks

This method checks the existence of the directory part of the path and verifies that the path itself is not a directory. It returns `false` and logs an error message to the console if an exception occurs during the validation process.
